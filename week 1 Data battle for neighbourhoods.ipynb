Pandas - Library for Data Analysis\n2. NumPy \u2013 Library to handle data in a vectorized manner\n3. JSON \u2013 Library to handle JSON files\n4. Geopy \u2013 To retrieve Location Data\n5.

Due to http request limitations, the number of places per suburb parameter would be set to 100\nand the radius parameter would be set to 700.\n\n\uf0a7 Folium- Python visualization library would be used to visualize the suburbs cluster distribution of Port\nElizabeth and Durban over an interactive leaflet map.\n\n\uf0a7 Extensive comparative analysis of two suburbs world be carried out to derive the desirable insights from\nthe outcomes using python\u2019s scientific libraries Pandas, NumPy and Scikit-learn.\n\n\uf0a7 Unsupervised machine learning algorithm K-mean clustering would be applied to form the clusters of\ndifferent categories of places residing in and around the neighborhoods. These clusters from each of those\ntwo chosen suburbs would be analyzed individually collectively and comparatively to derive the conclusions. "
