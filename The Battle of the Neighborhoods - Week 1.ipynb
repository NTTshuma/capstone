This research includes\npopulation rate, average house price, school ratings, crime rates, weather conditions, recreational\nfacilities, holiday destinations-tourism, Carnivals and Sports events/activity. etc.\n- Based on the above, a search engine algorithm would be an efficient tool to use that will allow users\nto enter cities and get the neighborhood name that best suits their lifestyle or living conditions.\n- In this project, we will study in detail the area classification using foursquare data and machine\nlearning segmentation and clustering. And segment areas of two cities based on the most common\nplaces captured from Foursquare."

It\nnow forms part of the Nelson Mandela Bay Metropolitan Municipality, which has a population of over 1.3\nmillion.\n(Source - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Port_Elizabeth ) "
